Pre-requisites
--------------

1.  SharePoint Online, SharePoint 2016 on-premise, SharePoint 2013
    on-premise.

2.  PowerShell v3.0 or greater installed on the machine. Windows 10/8.1
    and Windows Server 2012 and greater are all ready to go. Windows 7
    is preinstalled with v2.0 of PowerShell. PowerShell needs to be
    upgraded on Windows 7 machines. This can be done by downloading and
    installing the Windows Management Framework 4.0 from here:
    <https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/download/details.aspx?id=40855> .
    Download and install either the x64 or x86 version based on your
    version of Windows 7:

3.  Install the SharePoint PnP PowerShell cmdlets installed on the
    machine. You need to install the correct version of the cmdlets to
    target your version of SharePoint. Install the latest release msi
    files from here (new updates are applied monthly to the msi files):
    <https://github.com/SharePoint/PnP-PowerShell/releases>.

You will need to logon as a local Administrator to your machine to
